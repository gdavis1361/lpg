# Chattanooga Prep Relationship-Centered Platform: UI/UX Architecture

## Overview: System Architecture and Page Hierarchy

The Chattanooga Prep relationship-centered platform requires a thoughtfully structured interface that prioritizes relationship context over administrative functions. This document outlines the core UI/UX components needed to deliver an intuitive, unified experience for stakeholders who engage with the school across multiple roles.

The architecture follows a relationship-first design paradigm built on context-aware views rather than role-segregated interfaces. This approach ensures consistent user experience while minimizing the cognitive load typically associated with role-switching.

## Core Navigation Structure

### 1. Global Navigation System

The platform requires a dynamic global navigation system that adapts based on user context while maintaining global awareness:

- **Persistent Global Navigation Bar**
  - Context-aware role indicator showing current active perspective
  - Global search with relationship-focused results
  - Notification center showing cross-role alerts
  - User profile and preferences access

- **Contextual Secondary Navigation**
  - Role-adaptive navigation options that transform based on active context
  - Persistent visibility of relationship indicators across contexts
  - Quick-switch mechanism for transitioning between roles

### 2. Dashboard System

The dashboard implementation requires three distinct yet interconnected layers:

- **Unified Relationship Dashboard (Primary Landing Page)**
  - Relationship feed showing recent interactions across all roles
  - Prioritized attention indicators highlighting relationships needing engagement
  - Upcoming interaction opportunities across all roles
  - Key metrics visualization with role-filtering capabilities
  - Cross-role action triggers for common workflows

- **Role-Contextual Dashboards**
  - Fundraising relationship dashboard
  - Mentorship relationship dashboard
  - College guidance relationship dashboard
  - Each featuring role-specific KPIs while maintaining cross-role awareness

- **Student/Stakeholder-Centered Dashboards**
  - Comprehensive 360Â° view of individual students
  - Donor relationship dashboards
  - Alumni trajectory dashboards
  - Each presenting a unified view across all relationship dimensions

## Implementation Considerations

### Layout Architecture

The interface should utilize a responsive, component-based layout system built with CSS Grid and Flexbox through Tailwind's utility classes. Key considerations include:

- Fluid layouts that maintain relationship context across viewport sizes
- Consistent component patterns for relationship-focused elements
- Context-preservation during role-switching
- Strategic use of persistent UI elements for cross-role awareness
- Appropriate information density balancing comprehensiveness with clarity

### Page Composition Strategy

Each page should follow a consistent composition pattern:

1. Global context header with role indicators
2. Page-specific contextual navigation
3. Primary content area with role-adaptive information
4. Persistent relationship context panels
5. Action area with context-aware capabilities
6. Supplementary information panels with cross-role visibility

### Responsive Behavior Framework

The responsive system should implement a relationship-context preservation strategy:

- Progressive disclosure of relationship information as viewport size increases
- Context-preservation prioritization during viewport reduction
- Touch-optimized interaction patterns for relationship navigation on mobile
- Consistent placement of global navigation elements across breakpoints
- Strategic use of off-canvas patterns for preserving relationship context

### Accessibility Approach

The UI architecture must implement comprehensive accessibility patterns:

- Semantic HTML structure with appropriate ARIA attributes
- Keyboard navigation flows that respect relationship contexts
- Screen reader optimized content with meaningful relationship descriptions
- Sufficient color contrast while maintaining relationship visual indicators
- Focus management that preserves context during complex interactions

## Conclusion: A Unified Experience Architecture

This UI/UX architecture creates a seamless experience that acknowledges the interconnected nature of relationships at Chattanooga Prep. Rather than forcing users to mentally switch contexts between different roles and systems, it provides a unified interface that surfaces relevant relationship information at precisely the right moments.

The implementation leverages Next.js's server components and dynamic routing capabilities to create context-aware views that adapt to the user's current role while maintaining cross-role awareness. Tailwind's utility-first approach enables the rapid development of consistent UI components that can adapt to different relationship contexts while maintaining design coherence.

The result is not merely a collection of interfaces but a comprehensive relationship ecosystem that makes visible the previously invisible connections between people, enabling a fundamentally more human approach to institutional relationships.
