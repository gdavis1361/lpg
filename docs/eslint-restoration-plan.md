# ESLint Code Quality Restoration Plan

## Background

As part of our deployment stabilization effort, we temporarily disabled ESLint checks using the `NEXT_DISABLE_ESLINT=1` environment variable. This approach followed our `workflow_first_development` principle by prioritizing a working deployment, but accumulates technical debt that we need to address to maintain code quality standards.

## Restoration Approach

We will follow an incremental approach to restore ESLint checking that aligns with our `simplicity_first` and `enforce_dry` project rules:

### Phase 1: Configuration Standardization (Week 1)

1. **Configuration Simplification**
   - Consolidate all ESLint configurations into a single approach
   - Choose between traditional `.eslintrc.json` and modern flat config
   - Remove any remaining duplicate configurations

2. **Rule Set Definition**
   - Define essential rules vs. stylistic rules
   - Configure severity levels (error vs. warning)
   - Document rule customizations with clear justifications

3. **Integration with TypeScript**
   - Configure proper TypeScript-ESLint integration
   - Ensure compatibility with our TypeScript restoration plan
   - Set up rules to enforce type safety where applicable

### Phase 2: Incremental Implementation (Weeks 2-3)

1. **Development Environment Integration**
   - Enable ESLint in development with VS Code/IDE integration
   - Set up pre-commit hooks for staged files
   - Create automated fix scripts for common issues

2. **CI Pipeline Integration**
   - Add ESLint checking to CI pipeline as warnings only
   - Generate reports without failing builds
   - Track ESLint violation trends over time

3. **Targeted Rule Activation**
   - Enable rules one category at a time
   - Focus first on critical rules (security, best practices, potential bugs)
   - Address stylistic rules last

### Phase 3: Full Restoration (Week 4)

1. **Production Build Integration**
   - Remove `NEXT_DISABLE_ESLINT=1` from build scripts
   - Configure appropriate error severity for production builds
   - Ensure build performance remains acceptable

2. **Automated Fixing**
   - Implement automated fixes where safe
   - Document manual fix requirements
   - Create consistent patterns for common code structures

3. **Maintenance Strategy**
   - Define process for rule updates
   - Create exception policy for justified rule violations
   - Set up regular ESLint configuration reviews

## Success Metrics

- All ESLint violations addressed or explicitly suppressed with justification
- ESLint checking restored in all environments
- Build times remain within acceptable thresholds
- Consistent code style across codebase
- Zero regressions from linting-related changes

## Integration with Other Quality Initiatives

This plan should be coordinated with:

1. **TypeScript Restoration Plan**
   - Ensure compatible rule configurations
   - Coordinate timing of fixes to related issues
   - Use consistent suppression patterns when needed

2. **Code Coverage Improvements**
   - Use ESLint to enforce test coverage requirements
   - Add rules for ensuring test quality
   - Integrate with our coverage threshold of 80%

3. **Documentation Standards**
   - Add ESLint rules for enforcing JSDoc comments
   - Ensure component and function documentation
   - Maintain consistency with our documentation guidelines
