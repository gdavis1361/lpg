# Supabase Branch Environment Automation and Migration Validation

## Description
This PR implements a comprehensive workflow for Supabase branch environments and migration validation, following the project's workflow_first_development and simplicity_first principles. It automates the creation of isolated Supabase environments for feature branches, making database changes safer and more testable.

## Changes

### GitHub Actions Workflow
- Add `supabase-branch.yml` workflow to automatically create/update Supabase branch environments on PR creation
- Implement secure Doppler integration for environment variables
- Add PR commenting with branch details and connection instructions

### Migration Validation Framework
- Create validation script (`validate-migrations.js`) to check migration safety
- Extract safeguard blocks from existing migration plans into reusable functions
- Add SQL helper functions to facilitate validation

### Documentation
- Add `SUPABASE_WORKFLOW.md` with detailed workflow documentation
- Include best practices for migration development and validation

## Testing
To test this workflow:
1. Create a PR that modifies files in `lpg-backend/supabase/`
2. The workflow should automatically run and create a branch environment
3. A comment will be added to the PR with connection instructions
4. Verify that migrations can be applied to the branch environment

## Additional Notes
This implementation follows our defined action plan (Phase 1) focusing on workflow automation and migration validation. Subsequent phases will include type generation, contract management, and enhanced monitoring.
